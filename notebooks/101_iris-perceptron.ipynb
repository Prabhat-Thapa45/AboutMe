It is important to note that the way we implement the algorithm in this notebook is neither efficient, nor is it the way you would truly implement a neural network in practice (indeed, a perceptron model is a special case of a neural network). This example is set up to be pedagogical, such that you better understand the mechanism underlying the perceptron.\n",

It may also help to look again at the instructions for the Excel task in the slides for the first class.\n",
